This Python script defines a class named Square.

Currently, the class definition is empty (`pass` statement). 

You can extend this class to model a square shape with attributes and methods 
specific to squares, such as:

* Private attribute: `size` to represent the side length of the square.
* Methods:
    * `__init__(self, size)`: Constructor to initialize the square with a size.
    * `area(self)`: Method to calculate the area of the square.
    * `perimeter(self)`: Method to calculate the perimeter of the square.
    * `get_size(self)`: Method to get the current size of the square.
    * `set_size(self, new_size)`: Method to set a new size for the square 
      (with potential validation or error handling).

By adding these functionalities, you can create a Square object and use its methods 
to perform calculations and operations related to squares.
